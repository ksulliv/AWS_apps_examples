This project analyzes New York City Fire Incident Dispatch Data. 
You can access the data here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Fire-Incident-Dispatch-Data/8m42-w767 

The Fire Incident Dispatch Data file contains data that is generated by the Starfire Computer Aided Dispatch System. 
The data spans from the time the incident is created in the system to the time the incident is closed in the system. 
It covers information about the incident as it relates to the assignment of resources and the Fire Departmentâ€™s response to the emergency.
The data collects all The overall data set has 8.69 million rows and 29 columns. 
For this project, I ingested 15 columns and only rows that had values for incident_datetime and starfire_incident_id columns,
resulting in 7.97 millions rows (see assets folder, gauge.png)


Analysis - Response Time Differences in Incident Dispatch Across the Different Boroughs of NYC

New york City consist of 5 unique boroughs, how does the boroughs vary in terms of dispatches and what does these differences,]
and what do these differences tell us.

Question 1
First, is there any differences between the avergae dispatch response time and the average incident response time across boroughts?
To answer this question I created a bar chart that showed both by borough (see assets: visual01).
As you can see, Brooklyn has the shortest average dispatch response time and the shortest average response time while the Bronx has the longest
average dispatch time and Queens has the longest average response time. 

Question 2
Is there any reason for the average response time differences observed in question 1? 
To answer this, let's look at the top ten types of incidents per borough.
visual02 is a heatmap that show the Top 10 Incident Classifications across the boroughs. It is clear the Brooklyn, has much more Medical - Assisst Civilian 
incidents than the other boroughts. Could this be the reason Brooklyn's response times are the fastest? Urgent medical incidents occur at a
more often in Brooklyn, than other boroughs. 

Question 3
Is there differences in number of incidents between boroughs over time?
A time series is an appropriate choice to answer this question (see visual03). The time series shows the variation of dispatch incidents between 
boroughs over time. For mthe majority of the time period of this dataset Brooklyn indeed has the most dispatch incidents, followed by Manhattan,
then the Bronx. Interesting periods on the time series are the weeks of 2012-10-17 and 2017-12-20 which show an uptick in dispatch incidents in all
boroughs, while 2020-03-09 there is a noticeable dip in dispatch incidents. This goes beyond the purview of this project, but it would be 
interesting to dive into these dates to understand what caused these peaks and dips. 

Question 4
Last, in our investigation, of the differences in average response time between the boroughs we see differences in top 10 incident classifications
by boroughs and we also see differences in the number of incidents over time between boroughs. Final question is how does the average response time 
for the top ten incident classifications differ from borough to borough? 
To answer this question, a stacked bar chart of the top ten incidents, 
by average response time by borough was created (see visual04). Overall Brooklyn had the fastest average response time for the Top 10 Incident
Classifications. 

Overall, from this analysis, the main insights is that Brooklyn has the fastest average response time and this may be due to Brooklyn having 
higher numbers of urgent medical incidents which results in priority to respond fast. One caveat is that this analysis did not take into account
number of fire stations and resources available from borough to borough. Brooklyn could could have more resources than other boroughs therefore, 
resulting in faster response times.
